# YOUR REPORT HEADING <!-- (e.g., How do I spend my time?) -->

<!--
The code below is provided as a starting point for importing an `ics` file into R as a dataframe, doing some initial wrangling, and adding up the time spent on each activity. You are not required to use this code, so delete or modify it as you see fit. 

If you are using the code, be sure to update the capitalized parts with the relevant path to where your `ics` file is located, and set `eval = TRUE`.

As a reminder here's the link for exporting a Google calendar to ics (if on a Mac, you can hold cmd + click to open the page):
https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111?hl=en&ref_topic=10509946
-->
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Data import and preliminary wrangling
calendar_data <- "PATH/CALENDAR_FILENAME.ics" %>% 
  # Use ical package to import into R
  ical_parse_df() %>% 
  # Convert to "tibble" data frame format
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(
    # Use lubridate package to wrangle dates and times
    start_datetime = with_tz(start, tzone = "America/New_York"),
    end_datetime = with_tz(end, tzone = "America/New_York"),
    duration_sec = end_datetime - start_datetime,
    date = floor_date(start_datetime, unit = "day"),
    # Convert calendar entry to all lowercase and rename
    activity = tolower(summary))

# Compute total duration of time for each day & activity
activities <- calendar_data %>% 
  group_by(date, activity) %>%
  summarize(duration_sec = sum(duration_sec))
```

# YOUR REFLECTION HEADING <!-- e.g., Reflection -->

<!--
Write your one-page reflection here in paragraph form.  In particular, address:

* What difficulties in the data collection and analysis process did you encounter?  Identify two of your main hurdles in gathering accurate data.

* What implications does that have for future data collection and/or analysis projects? 

* How much data do you think you'd need to collect in order to answer your question(s) of interest? Would it be hard to collect that data? Why or why not?

* As someone who provides data, what expectations do you have when you give your data (e.g. to Facebook, Google, MapMyRun, etc.)?  

* As someone who analyzes others' data, what ethical responsibilities do you have?
