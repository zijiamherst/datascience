# Reflection

<!--
Write your one-page reflection here in paragraph form.  In particular, address:

* What difficulties in the data collection and analysis process did you encounter?  Identify two of your main hurdles in gathering accurate data.

* What implications does that have for future data collection and/or analysis projects? 

* How much data do you think you'd need to collect in order to answer your question(s) of interest? Would it be hard to collect that data? Why or why not?

* As someone who provides data, what expectations do you have when you give your data (e.g. to Facebook, Google, MapMyRun, etc.)?  

* As someone who analyzes others' data, what ethical responsibilities do you have?
