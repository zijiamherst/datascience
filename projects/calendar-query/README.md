# Calendar Query Proposal 

Identify **2â€“4 primary questions** of interest to you about how you spend your time. We may be sharing results with peers, so **be sure you identify questions you feel comfortable sharing with your peers and instructor**. You will be collecting data daily for 14 days (or more!) after your proposal is approved. 


Feel free to expand upon the basic question of "How do I spend my time?" or explore a variation of it. Some other ideas include...
* Document *intended time* doing things (e.g. studying, sleeping) versus *actual time* doing those things, and compare results

* Document time spent on each course, and/or time spent on different parts of a course (e.g. in class, reading, homework, etc.)

* Document time spent on school vs. work vs. leisure vs. rest, etc.

* If you already use Google Calendar as a way to keep track of your schedule, you could compare how your time was spent last year at this time versus how your time is being spent this semester.

*Note that you are not wed to the ideas you record here.  The visualizations and table can change before your final submission.  But, I want to make sure your plan aligns with your questions and that you're on the right track.Note that you are not wed to the ideas you record here.

**Copy and paste these questions into a new issue in your private repo. Respond to these questions by 10pm ET on Thursday, September 9. I will respond with my approval or comments for revision.**

## Identify what questions you are planning to focus on



## Describe two visualizations (type of plot, coordinates, visual cues, etc.) you imagine creating that help address your questions of interest




## Describe one table (what will the rows be?  what will the columns be?) you imagine creating that helps address your questions of interest
