# Problem Sets

This course is designed to support effective learning of the material. This will happen in part through twice-weekly problem sets. The two problem sets, Reading Sets and Practice Sets, target different stages of learning. They are due at different times of the week so that you are continuing spaced practice throughout the week. After all, learning a programming language is like learning any other language: practice, practice, practice is the key to fluency.  

## Reading Sets (due by 10pm ET on Mondays)
A more thorough reading and light practice of the textbook reading prior to class allows us to jump into things more quickly in class and dive deeper into topics. As you actively read the textbook, you will work through the Reading Sets to help you engage with the new concepts and skills, often by replicating on your own the examples covered in the book. Reading sets should be completed on your own without help from your peers, but you may ask me for help if needed.

## Practice Sets (due by 10pm ET on Fridays)
During the week, you will get further practice with the material by working through the Practice Set, a set of problems designed to give you practice beyond the examples produced in the text. You may work through these problems with peers, but all work must be completed by you (see the Honor Code in the syllabus) and you must indicate who you worked with. Even then, the best approach here is to try the problems on your own before discussing them with peers, and then write your final solutions yourself.

# Workflow

Everyone in the class has access to the [*profbailey-course-content*](https://github.com/stat231-f21/profbailey-course-content) repo. This repository will be updated throughout the semester, and it will allow you to have the most up-to-date materials on your local computer (or server profile if using the RStudio server). 

You should have already cloned the *profbailey-course-content* repo and your own personal repo for the course.

1. Use the **Files** pane in RStudio to navigate to the *profbailey-course-content* repo and open the repo project (*profbailey-course-content.Rproj*).

2. *Pull* any changes to the repo by clicking on the Git toolbar menu or the Git pane in RStudio and then clicking **Pull**. Remember, you don't have permission to push any changes to the *profbailey-course-content* repo!

3. *Copy* the relevant file to your own repo:

    a. In RStudio, on the **Files** pane, navigate to the *profbaily-course-contents* repo, and check the box next to the file you want to copy (usually within the "homeworks" or "labs" folder).

    b. Click on **More** $\rightarrow$ **Copy to...** and navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g., *homework*) in your personal repo where you want to save the file. 
    
    c. Click save and then close the *profbailey-course-content* repo.
    
4. Still in RStudio, navigate to your own repo and open the corresponding repo project. 

5. In the **Git** pane, you should see the new file that you added to your repo. Check the box next to the file, and then click the **Commit** button. Add an appropriate commit message (end the sentence *if applied, this commit will...*, e.g., "Add rs1 file"), and click **Commit**. Then, click **Push**.

6. Open the file you want to work on and get started! After you make changes to an assignment, *commit* them. At a minimum, I recommend you commit each time you've finished a question.  

7. You should occasionally *push* the updated version of the assignment back onto GitHub. When you are ready to push, you can click on the Git pane and then click **Push**. You can also do this after each commit in RStudio by clicking **Push** in the top right of the *Commit* pop-up window.
